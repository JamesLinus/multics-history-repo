03/31/83  library_descriptor_compiler, ldc

Syntax:  ldc desc_name {-control_arg}


Function:  compiles a library description to produce a library
descriptor data segment.

Refer to "Library Description Language" in the Multics Library
Maintenance (AN80) manual for a discussion of the syntax and semantics
of the library description language.


Arguments:
desc_name
   is the relative pathname of the segment containing the library
   description to be compiled.  If this pathname does not end with an
   ld suffix, then one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   indicates that the brief form of error messages is to be used for
   all errors diagnosed during the compilation.  (See "Notes" below.)
-long, -lg
   indicates that the long form of error messages is to be used for all
   errors diagnosed during the compilation.  (See "Notes" below.)


Notes:  If the segment being compiled is called descriptor_name.ld,
then the compilation generates a segment called descriptor_name.alm in
the working directory.  This segment can be assembled by the alm
command to produce the library descriptor data segment.

If neither -brief nor -long is used, then the long form of error
messages is used for the first occurrence of an error, and the brief
form is used for subsequent occurrences of that error.

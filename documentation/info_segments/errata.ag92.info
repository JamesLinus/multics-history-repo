pg 3-20:  for the "alm" command, under ARGUMENTS change the
     description of "path" to the following.

         path
             is the pathname of an ALM source program; the alm
             suffix need not be given.  The archive component
             pathname convention is allowed.


pg 3-101:  for the "calc" command, under NOTES ON ASSIGNMENT
     STATEMENTS replace

         The value of an expression can be assigned to a
         variable.  The name of the variable must be from one to
         eight characters in length and must be made up of
         letters (uppercase and/or lowercase) and the underscore
         character (_).


     with

         The value of an expression can be assigned to a
         variable.  The name of the variable must be from one to
         eight characters in length and must be made up of
         letters (uppercase and/or lowercase), digits (if not at
         the beginning of the name), and the underscore character
         (_).


pg 3-160:  for the "copy" command, under NOTES add the paragraph
     below.
pg 3-164; for the "copy_dir" command, under NOTES add the
     paragraph below.
pg 3-585; for the "move" command, under NOTES add the paragraph
     below.
pg 3-591; for the "move_dir" command, under NOTES add the
     paragraph below.

         If copying a non-empty mailbox requires that the
         max_length characteristic of the source be applied to
         the target, then the target max_length value will take
         on the default value that was given to it when created.


pg 3-263 to 3-264:  replace the documentation for
     "display_mailing_address" with the following.

         Syntax as a command:  dsmla {name(s)} {-control
         arguments}

         Function:  displays the specified mail table entries, in
         the format used in message headers displayed by
         read_mail.  The default mailing address(es) is(are)
         given, and any alias names associated with the mail
         table entry are displayed.  In addition, if the mail
         table entry specifies an ACS segment (to allow other
         maintainers the mail table entry), the pathname of this
         segment is also displayed.


         Arguments:
         name(s)
           is (are) the Person_id(s) or alias(es) of the user
           whose mailing address should be displayed, or the
           name(s) or alias(es) of a mail table entry for a forum
           or mailing list.  The command displays the mailing
           address for each one (printing a warning message for
           those that are invalid).  If none are given, the
           default is the mailing address of the user invoking
           the dsmla command.  The star convention is allowed and
           the address information of any name(s) matching the
           starname will be displayed (See "Notes on starnames").


         Control arguments:
         -name STR, -nm STR
           Specifies a mail table entry name.  By using this
           control argument, STR may literally contain characters
           which are starname characters (e.g.  *, ?).

         Notes on starnames:
           As dsmla is insensitive to the type case of the
           specified name, the matching of starnames is also
           performed insensitive to type case.  If more than one
           mail table are equal (except for type case) and all
           match the given starname, then all are displayed.


pg 3-294:  for the "enter_abs_request" command, under ARGUMENTS
     change the description of "path" to the following.

     path
         specifies the pathname of the absentee control segment
         associated with this request.  The absin suffix is
         assumed.  If a pathname is given, it identifies the
         absin segment.  If only an entryname is given, the absin
         segment is located using the exec_com search list.


pg 3-295:  for the "enter_abs_request" command, add the following
     to the CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.


     -authorization STR, -auth STR
         sets the authorization of the process to that specified
         by STR.  STR is a character string composed of level and
         category names for the desired authorization, separated
         by commas.  STR cannot contain any embedded blank or tab
         characters.  (The short names for each level and
         category always contain no blanks or tabs, and can be
         used whenever the corresponding long names contain
         blanks or tabs.)  STR must represent an authorization
         that is within the range of minimum and maximum


         authorization of Person_id on the Project_id.  If
         -authorization is omitted, your current login
         authorization is used.  (See the Programmer's Reference
         Manual for more information about process
         authorizations.)  Allowed authorization range can be
         displayed via the "user auth_range" command.


     -home_dir path, -hd path
         sets the home directory of the absentee process to the
         path specified, if the project administrator allows such
         changes.  The "user attributes" command displays allowed
         attributes.  The vhomedir attribute is required to use
         the -home_dir control argument.  The specified home dir
         cannot exceed 64 characters and must be specified as an
         absolute pathname.

     -no_start_up, -ns
         instructs the standard process overseer not to execute
         the start_up.ec segment in the absentee process, if the
         project administrator allows it.  The "user attributes"
         command displays allowed attributes.  The nostartup
         attribute is required to use this control argument.


     -process_overseer path, -po path
         sets the process overseer for the absentee process to
         the procedure given by path if the project administrator
         allows this.  If path ends in the characters ",direct",
         the specified procedure is called directly during
         process initialization rather than by the standard
         system-provided procedure.  This means that the program
         used by path must perform the tasks that would have been
         performed by the standard procedure.  The length of the
         process_overseer path should not exceed 64 characters.
         The "user attributes" command displays allowed
         attributes.  The vinitproc attribute is required to use
         this control argument.


     -ring N, -rg N
         sets the initial ring to N if this ring number is within
         the range of the registered minimum ring and maximum
         ring.  This range may be displayed via the "user
         ring_range" command.

     -start_up
         instructs the standard process overseer to execute the
         start_up.ec segment if it exists.  (Default)


pg 3-296:  for the "enter_abs_request" command, add the following
     to the NOTES section.

     When -proxy is given, no attempt is made by ear to validate
     attribute dependent control arguments.  Since the job is
     submitted on behalf of another user, the attributes for the
     proxy user will be validated only by the answering service
     when it attempts to run the job.  Attribute dependent
     control arguments are:

          -no_start_up
          -home_dir
          -authorization
          -process_overseer
          -ring


pg 3-395:  for the "fortran" command, under ARGUMENTS change the
     description of "path" to the following.

         path
             is the pathname of a FORTRAN source program; you
             need not give the fortran suffix.  The archive
             component pathname convention is allowed.


pg 3-560:  for the "memo" command, under LIST OF MEMO OPTIONS
     delete the following sentence under the
     "-repeat_when_processed" control argument description.

         This is useful for memos that are only significant
         within a single process.


pg 3-637:  for the "pl1" command, under ARGUMENTS change the
     description of "path" to the following.

         path
             is the pathname of a PL/I source program; the pl1
             suffix need not be given.  The archive component
             pathname convention is allowed.


pg 3-640:  for the "pl1" command, add the following to the
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

         - version
             Requests printing of the current version of the
             compiler.  (Default)

         - no_version
             Suppresses printing of the current version of the
             compiler.


pg 3-714:  change the documentation for the "program_interrupt"
     command to the following.

     Name:  program_interrupt, pi

     Syntax as a command:  pi {-control_arg}

     Function:  informs a suspended invocation of a subsystem
     that the user wishes to abort the current request.

     Control arguments:
     -no_restore, -ns
         does not restore the standard I/O attachments (see
         "Notes").



     Notes:  The program interrupt command is used with
     interactive subsystems.  Interactive subsystems are commands
     that accept user requests from the terminal.  To abort a
     subsystem request, the user uses the quit (or break) key to
     interrupt execution, and then gives the program_interrupt
     command.  If the subsystem supports the use of the
     program_interrupt command, it will abort the interrupted
     request and ask the user for a new one.  If the subsystem
     does not support the use of program_interrupt, the command
     will print an error message.  The user may then either
     restart the interrupted operation with the "start" command,
     or abort the entire subsystem invocation with the "release"
     command.



     This command restores the attachments of the user_input,
     user_output, and error_output switches and the mode of
     user_i/o to their values at the time of interruption unless
     you give -no_restore.

     If there is more than one suspended command in your stack,
     the stack is searched for a program that supports
     program_interrupt and any interventing programs are
     released.


pg 3-729:  for the "query" command, add the following to the
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

         -no_trim
             Does not trim trailing spaces from the question
             argument.

         -trim
             Trims trailing spaces from the question argument.
             (Default)


pg 3-804:  for the "response" command, add the following to the
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

         -no_trim
             Does not trim trailing spaces from the question
             argument.

         -trim
             Trims trailing spaces from the question argument.
             (Default)

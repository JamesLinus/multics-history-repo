Syntax:  nt {optional_args}


Function:	 performs a return to its caller, and does nothing.


Arguments:
optional_args
   are optional arguments, which may have any value, and are ignored.


Notes:  This command makes use of a special feature in the Multics
Linking Mechanism which allows it to be executed by any reference name;
thus, it can be used as a "stub" procedure for development of programs.
To do this, initiate it with the reference name of the program it is
supposed to replace.  It cannot be used in this fashion if the
entrypoint name is different from the reference name.

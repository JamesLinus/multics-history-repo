pg B-5 to B-6:  add the following RMAIL mode commands.

     ?   rmail-help
         Displays as printout a brief description of each of the
         RMAIL mode commands.

     x   rmail-toggle-seen
         Toggles the "Seen" switch of the current message being
         read.  The state of this switch is indicated as minor
         mode "Seen" in the RMAIL buffer.


     f   rmail-forward
         Forwards the current message to a list of addresses
         which are prompted for in the mini-buffer.
         Redistribution comments can be added by supplying a
         numeric argument (e.g., 3f).  A comment buffer which
         allows the use of ^X^Q (quit), ^X^A (acknowledge), and
         ^X^S (send) will be created.


pg B-7:  replace the first paragraph of the page with the
     following.

         Once you have invoked the r request, you can use the
         MAIL mode requests as well as the standard Emacs
         requests.  In addition, the following requests are
         available (refer to the individual rmail request to
         determine which of these requests are valid).


pg B-7:  add the following RMAIL command description.

         ^X^A rmail-toggle-ack
         In a mail-mode or forwarding comments buffer, toggles
         the "Ack" request of the mail.


pg B-7:  replace the description of ^X^S with the following.

         ^X^S send-the-mail, foward-the-mail
         Sends the reply, or forwards the message and comments,
         and returns to RMAIL and its window.
